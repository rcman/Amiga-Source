# Amiga Source


This is source from around 1991. I used to use it a lot more but have totally lost touch with using it. When I look at it now it's hard to believe I used to code in it. I will need to start at ground zero again, right from hello world to get used to it again. 

I would love to make something for the amiga. I'm looking at doing a game in assembler or C and have also looked in to Blitz and Amos.

Let's hope something comes from this.

RC


Update: I will add the include files that this is missing.
Update: I have cleaned up the Include files. The one labeled francv1.win.i should be the one used. I am still working out issues when I convert it for Amiga it still says the file contains binary data

Will let you know when this is i fixed
